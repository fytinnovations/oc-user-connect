# Getting started

## Installation

The `Fytinnovations.Userconnect` plugin depends on `RainLab.Translate`.

### Via Github

- Create a folder inside the plugins directory called fytinnovations/userconnect .
- Clone or copy the contents of the repository to this folder.
- Logout and login to the backend to see the plugin in effect or alternatively you can run the command php artisan october:up.

### Via Marketplace

The plugin can be found on the official [October CMS Marketplace](https://octobercms.com/plugin/fytinnovations-userconnect). You can install it via the Projects feature of the Marketplace itself or via your installation's backend settings.

### Via Console

The easiest way to get you started is by using the command line:

```bash
php artisan plugin:install rainlab.translate
php artisan plugin:install fytinnovations.userconnect
```
